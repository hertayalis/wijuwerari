Now, the pair has coasted their way to the final five alongside fellow Reba member <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Alley</a>, as well as Belo members <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jake O’Kane</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katurah Topps</a>.</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=572 data-injectable=true>Will one half of the showmance manage to take home the title of “Sole Survivor” and thw million-dollar cash prize on Wednesday (December 20) when the highly-anticipated finale rolls around? Only time will tell…</p><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=227 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, with the question of who wins Survivor 45 aside, fans of the franchise have another burning question: Are showmancers Dee Valladares and Austin Li Coon dating in real life? Keep scrolling to see for yourself…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Dee-and-Austin.png><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately for Dee and Austin shippers, it looks like we will need to wait even longer to find out whether or not the two lovebirds are a couple post-filming. Neither Dee nor Austin has spoken out about the situation (likely due to the NDAs imposed by CBS), but viewers have taken to Reddit to create theories of their own, primarily based on some social media sleuthing.</p><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>When the question was asked via Reddit as to whether or not Dee and Austin are dating in real life, 26 viewers shared their thoughts, many of which believe that they are still together after Survivor 45 wrapped.</p><p>“I honestly feel like it’s been the worst kept secret this season. Jeff said during pre-season press that a relationship emerged after filming and there really aren’t any other possibilities. They also follow each other’s family members on social media and are constantly reposting/liking things that imply they are in a relationship.”</p><p>“I definitely think they are. He has a post up on his Insta, someone commented ‘great caption’ (I think it was someone from a past season) and Austin replied ‘I had a lil help with this one 😉’ and the person then responded ‘your secret is safe with me,’ and then Austin hearted the comment. I have WAY too much time on my hands…”</p><p>“Yes. People have posted some of their social media interactions on [Reddit] which allude that they’re together.”</p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=143 data-injectable=false>While a majority of the commenters believe that Dee and Austin are a couple post-filming, some respondents had a much more pessimistic outlook.</p><p>“I’m not getting my hopes up. I think any social media/Twitter stuff could be genuine, but it could also just be them having fun and reminiscing on what happened on the show. They don’t live near each other and I don’t see any signs of them ever being in the same city at the same time aside from Survivor events. On social media, he’s in Chicago and she’s in Miami almost exclusively, and I feel like there would have been SOME fan sightings of them together or some Instagram posts/stories of her in Chicago or him in Florida at some point, which there haven’t been so who knows. I guess we’ll know by the end of next week.”</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false>While there is no way to know for sure, do you think the love between Dee Valladares and Austin Li Coon will last a lifetime? With <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Frannie Marin and Matt Blankinship</a> from Survivor 44 still going strong, our fingers are crossed (to say the least).</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=617 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, to find out who takes home the title of “Sole Survivor” and the million-dollar cash prize at the end of&nbsp;Survivor 45, catch the highly-anticipated finale on December 20 at 8pm ET/PT on CBS, or the following day on Paramount Plus. Until then, it is safe to say that we will be keeping up with the two lovebirds on Instagram until further notice…</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yivsRmqq6qpp7DsL6MbWxmq5ikxK6tzZycq6tdmbKmedWao6WZlJa%2Fpr%2BMmqWdZZGqwLW1zWajomWTpLyvecOaq6Kml2K2r3nRnpilZZyes6Z7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nora-aunor-net-worth-174413.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nora Aunor Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-net-worth-of-michael-okeefe.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Net Worth of Michael OKeefe</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elias-phoenix-net-worth-142008.html>Elias Phoenix Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gonzalo-lira-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Gonzalo Lira Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./show.html>Rambus DRAM Part 2: Performance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-ratajkowski-sheer-slip-dress-cowboy-boots.html>See Emily Ratajkowski Step Out in a Sheer Slipdress and Cowboy Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-city-has-been-named-the-murder-capital-of-missouri.html>This City Has Been Named the Murder Capital of Missouri</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
