In her lengthy caption, however, the actress <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B-AiNNbJqyv/>announced</a> that she had COVID-19.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>"I'm going to heal here, in my own home!"</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/0623975901b969362b690c34d466395a.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Debi Mazar on June 27, 2017 in New York City | Photo: Getty Images</p><p><h3 class=ih>DEBI MAZAR IS OKAY</h3></p><p class=dh>The first thing she pointed out, though, was that she was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/debi-mazar-tested-positive-coronavirus>doing okay</a>. Debi then explained that her husband and two teen daughters got an "odd bug" back in February that made them sick.</p><p class=dh>According to the actress, they all had "low-grade fever, headaches, sore throat, body aches, ears ringing, and a dry cough." Fortunately, they got better rather quickly, so she figured out that it was seasonal.</p><p class=dh>On March 15, Debi started feeling the same symptoms but more intense. At that point, she believed that she got either the flu or coronavirus. The "Younger" star believed that her immune system got weakened after having some drinks and smoking some cigarettes the previous night.</p><p class=dh>Debi then contacted her doctor to see if she could get tested for coronavirus, but he said that she didn't meet the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-response-north-carolina/testing-and>criteria</a>.</p><p><h3 class=ih>SHE EVENTUALLY GOT TESTED</h3></p><p class=dh>The actress considered that the "criteria" was "crazy" because, as a New Yorker, she had taken the subway, gone to the theater, grocery stores, and many other crowded places.</p><p class=dh>Fortunately, there was a CityMD/Urgent Care in her neighborhood with test kits. After testing negative for the flu, she took the COVID-19 test and had to wait five days for the results.</p><p class=dh>Debi Mazar's kids and husband decided to self-isolate for 14 days. Even though they have no symptoms, the actress believes that they all have it already. About her condition, Debi <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B-AiNNbJqyv/>wrote</a>:</p><p class=dh>"One day I feel crappy and the next I'm normal.

[sic].</p><p><h3 class=ih>PEOPLE SHOWING SUPPORT ON SOCIAL MEDIA</h3></p><p class=dh>Finally, she asked her followers to stay home, protect themselves and their beloved ones, and build up their immune systems.</p><p class=dh>Shortly after Debi opened up about her diagnosis, people took to social media to share their support and best wishes.</p><p class=dh>One of them <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/glenn_biz/status/1241457080642555905>urged</a> Debi to fight the disease and never give up on it. Another Twitter follower <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/Nielske020/status/1241456483075792897>asked</a> her to stay "safe and brave" for herself and her family, and also wished her all the best.

The actress confessed that she has been trying to clean as much as possible to prevent them from getting the virus, as well.</p><p class=dh>After digging into some of her symptoms and saying that the coronavirus should not be taken lightly, Debi added that she would start posting things that were not specifically related to the disease.</p><p class=dh>Unfortunately, the "Younger" star is not the only celebrity to be tested positive for coronavirus.</p><p class=dh>Nowadays, Debi Mazar and many other celebrities have urged people to stay home and follow the experts' recommendations to avoid spreading the coronavirus even more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtnaW1gZnqlscGiZKaZqpa%2FtHnFmqWsZaOdvLh50q6nqaeiqXqiucidZKGdomK9b7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./everything-we-know-about-lisa-vanderpumps-new-show.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Everything We Know About Lisa Vanderpump's New Show</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-korg-gay-debated-by-marvel-fandom-after-thor-love-thunder-scene.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Is Korg gay' debated by Marvel fandom after Thor: Love &amp;amp; Thunder scene</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elias-phoenix-net-worth-142008.html>Elias Phoenix Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gonzalo-lira-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Gonzalo Lira Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./show.html>Rambus DRAM Part 2: Performance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-ratajkowski-sheer-slip-dress-cowboy-boots.html>See Emily Ratajkowski Step Out in a Sheer Slipdress and Cowboy Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-city-has-been-named-the-murder-capital-of-missouri.html>This City Has Been Named the Murder Capital of Missouri</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
