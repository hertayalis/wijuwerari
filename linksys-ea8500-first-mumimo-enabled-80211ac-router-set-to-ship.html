As a recap:</p><ul><li>The first 3-stream 802.11ac routers (based on the Broadcom BCM4706 chipset) started <a href=#>shipping in May 2012</a>, with Buffalo Technologies and Netgear leading the way. There were marketed as AC1750 units (3x3 5 GHz providing&nbsp; up to 1300 Mbps and 3x3 2.4 GHz providing up to 450 Mbps). The street pricing of the AC1750 routers started to go down once Qualcomm started shipping their first-generation 802.11ac router platforms in products such as the <a href=#>TP-LINK Archer C7</a> in April 2013.</li><li>In Q4 2013, a wave of AC1900 units started to hit the market. Netgear's <a href=#>Nighthawk R7000</a>, a popular member in this series, still continues to sell well in the market. These units still used a 3x3 5 GHz radio for up to 1300 Mbps, but the 2.4 GHz had some proprietary Broadcom extensions (TurboQAM) to support up to 600 Mbps in an end-to-end Broadcom environment.</li><li>In 2014, Quantenna began to bring their technology lead in the Wi-Fi space to the market with their Wave 2 <a href=#>4x4 802.11ac chipset</a>. Despite being announced at CES 2014, the Asus RT-AC87U began to <a href=#>ship in July</a> with the QSR1000 radio coupled with a Broadcom SoC. Netgear started to ship the same radio coupled with a Qualcomm IPQ8064 SoC in the <a href=#>Nighthawk X4 in September 2014</a>. The QSR1000's Wave 2 feature set includes support for MU-MIMO, but neither of these routers shipped with MU-MIMO enabled in the firmware (citing lack of client support at that point of time). Given the 4x4 configuration, these routers were tagged as AC2350 / AC2400 units (600 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz band and 1733 Mbps in the 5 GHz band)</li><li>In the midst of these Wave 2 product launches, Qualcomm announced plans for their Wave 2 802.11ac platforms (both routers and clients) in <a href=#>April 2014</a>. Broadcom, being late to the Wave 2 party, decided to bring out the XStream platform with dual 5 GHz radios (six-stream configuration) also in April. They were able to get it quickly into the market too, with the Netgear <a href=#>Nighthawk X6 R8000</a> becoming available in June 2014.</li><li>At CES 2015, we saw the first set of routers based on Qualcomm's QCA9880 4x4 Wave 2 802.11ac router platform getting announced. Vendors such as <a href=#>TP-LINK</a> and <a href=#>TRENDnet</a> were expecting their AC2600 class routers to ship towards the middle of the year.</li></ul><p>Coming back to today's announcement regarding the EA8500, Linksys is becoming the first vendor to start shipping a QCA9980-based router. The important aspect here is that the router will ship with MU-MIMO enabled. Client devices with MU-MIMO enabled are also coming into the market just now (more on that in our detailed review). Hopefully, this announcement will spur both Netgear and Asus to enable MU-MIMO in the firmware for their Quantenna-based routers.</p><p>The salient features of the EA8500 router are listed below:</p><ul><li>4x4 802.11ac with MU-MIMO and beamforming support</li><li>QCA9980 radio + 1.4 GHz dual-core IPQ8064 SoC</li><li>Simultaneous dual-band operation (5 GHz 802.11ac - 1733 Mbps, 5 GHz 802.11n - 600 Mbps, 2.4 GHz 802.11n - 800 Mbps)</li><li>1x USB 3.0, 1x USB 2.0 / eSATA</li><li>4x 1Gbps LAN, 1x 1Gbps WAN</li><li>Adjustable antennas for optimal performance</li></ul><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/9242/Linksys-EA8500-back_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>One important point to note is that MU-MIMO capabilities will translate into real benefit only when there are multiple MU-MIMO-capable client devices talking to the router simultaneously. This will probably be a common scenario in enterprise Wi-Fi deployments soon. However, in a typical household, we would imagine that a situation involving multiple MU-MIMO clients is probably at least a good year away. Qualcomm is targeting an end-to-end play here, as the <a href=#>announcement made last year</a> included a number of products in the client space with MU-MIMO capabilities.</p><p>Linksys is accepting pre-orders at $280 for the <a href=#>EA8500</a> today with shipments slated for May 10, 2015. Wide retail and e-tail availability is also expected starting next week. There is no doubt that MU-MIMO will be the most efficient way to boost Wi-Fi performance in the near future, and it is good that Linksys and Qualcomm are teaming together to accelerate its market adoption.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIZzgJFoo6Kmm6jGtHnEmm9uaGBis6q%2B0q1kpq2dnrqwecSnmJuklZl6eXyRamiam12nvLbAxKtkrJ2kYsGwedKhoKk%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./qualcomm-announces-quick-charge-4.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Supports USB Type-C Power Delivery</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-track-devices-with-echo-show-15.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to track devices with Echo Show 15</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elias-phoenix-net-worth-142008.html>Elias Phoenix Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gonzalo-lira-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Gonzalo Lira Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./show.html>Rambus DRAM Part 2: Performance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-ratajkowski-sheer-slip-dress-cowboy-boots.html>See Emily Ratajkowski Step Out in a Sheer Slipdress and Cowboy Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-city-has-been-named-the-murder-capital-of-missouri.html>This City Has Been Named the Murder Capital of Missouri</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
