Something similar is brewing in the boxing world right now, as <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Devin Haney</strong></a> is coming off a blockbuster win over <strong>Regis Prograis</strong>. In a not-so-surprising turn of events, <strong>Calvin Ford, </strong>head coach for <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Gervonta Davis</strong></a> has branded Haney’s recent win as a ‘Tailor Made’ fight.</span></p><p><span><strong>Bill Haney</strong>, Devin’s father, previously went on a rant criticizing ‘Tank’ Davis and his team for ducking a fight with ‘The Dream’ Haney. So, while appearing in a recent interview with <strong>ES News</strong>, Calvin Ford, expressed his thoughts about Haney’s win over Regis Prograis. It’s worth mentioning that a fight between ‘Tank’ and Haney has been the center of public attention for the longest time, but nothing came out of it. Though the fighters never met in the ring, the people around them are butting heads. Here’s what Calvin said!</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>Calvin Ford claims people don’t understand boxing</b></h2><p><span>While speaking to <strong>Elie Seckbach</strong> from ES News, Calvin outright labeled the fight tailor-made. When probed about why he thinks the fight was strategically arranged for Haney’s benefit, Calvin claimed people don’t understand boxing. </span><i><span>“I call it a tailor-made [fight]…Listen, you don’t understand, people don’t understand boxing,”</span></i><span> said Ford.</span></p><p><span>He went on to elaborate on his statement, claiming that everything was exactly the way Haney wanted. Calvin even suggested that Haney knew the promoters and knew about what kind of opponent he was facing. </span><i><span>“All the stars were lined up for that fight. He knew the promoter. They knew who he was dealing with…They say, ‘I can’t fight at 135, I am going to 140 for this world title,’ and it worked out in their favor. That’s why I said it’s tailor-made,” </span></i><span>said Calvin. With that out of the way, here’s what Bill said about Gervonta Davis.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>Bill Haney claims they don’t need Gervonta Davis</b></h2><p><span>In a recent interview with <strong>Fight Hype</strong>, Bill Haney criticized Davis for avoiding a fight against his son. He asked Davis to send a fair fight contract if he was the face of boxing, something that shows he is interested in fighting Haney. </span><i><span>“If you’re the face of boxing, then send over something, man, you know what I’m saying. Something respectful like you really trying to do this s**t,”</span></i><span> said Bill.</span></p><p><span>Bill then proceeded to suggest that everyone Haney fights is fairly paid for their efforts. </span><i><span>“Every fighter that Devin f**k with gets paid, man, the most money, man, knock it off, man. That’s bunk business, man,” </span></i><span>said Bill. However, Devin’s father also claimed they don’t need Davis and that Davis should live on welfare cheques. </span><i><span>“Listen, we don’t need you. Let the welfare feed you for real,” </span></i><span>said Bill.</span></p><p><span>After Haney’s Saturday night performance, Gervonta Davis’ coach accused Haney of strategically planning the fight. On the other hand, Haney’s father claims Gervonta Davis is trying to avoid a fight against his son. This could very well be the beginning of a great clash between Haney and Davis. Do you think Davis would fight Haney? If they did, who do you think would win?&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Watch This Story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>5 Potential Opponents For Gervonta Davis</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue8Gor6Kml2K7psPSZpilpF2ptaZ50q2Yq6tdrLKzsYyloKedlGLCsXnFqKlmrJiWwW6yyKCfrWWXmr%2B3u82tmGackau2tHnTq5iippWneqSty6%2Bgp2WWpL%2BlecKlmKKlo2KxpsLIp2ShmZ6axm6%2FjLCgp2Wfq7KzedGenqKrXaW%2FsLPRmqCsZaeWwG7AwKKjqKpdoq6lsY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./anthony-harris-net-worth-269419.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Anthony Harris Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./asus-zenbook-pro-duo-ux58-a-dual-screen-laptop-with-100-dcip3-oled.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>A Dual Screen Laptop with 100% DCI-P3 OLED</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elias-phoenix-net-worth-142008.html>Elias Phoenix Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gonzalo-lira-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Gonzalo Lira Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./show.html>Rambus DRAM Part 2: Performance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-ratajkowski-sheer-slip-dress-cowboy-boots.html>See Emily Ratajkowski Step Out in a Sheer Slipdress and Cowboy Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-city-has-been-named-the-murder-capital-of-missouri.html>This City Has Been Named the Murder Capital of Missouri</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
