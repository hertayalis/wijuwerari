Then just a few weeks later he was named in the lawsuit filed against <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Diddy</a> by producer Lil Rod. Even though everyone involved has denied all of the allegations that didn't stop fans from taking them at face value and attacking Meek online.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Now he's beginning the steps of defending himself, starting with a 2023 interview with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DJ Drama</a> where he shut down Meek being the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jay-Z</a> of his generation. To say his reaction came off a bit incoherent would be an understatement. "I give yall my honest without speaking on drake …. Bike life culture 'meek billionaire culture connected to rap … really been through poverty the system 'meek' really changing laws 'meek' showed the most new artist love with my platform 'meek'" his tweet reads. That led to a series of tweets where he defended his legacy and his place in hip hop. Check out the tweet that kicked the thread off below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-meek-mill-standing-up-for-himself>Meek Mill Standing Up For Himself</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Later tweets in the thread saw Meek trying to speak to his credibility as a social justice advocate. "I really changed like 4 laws that really help stop the cycle of probation for the average person coming up in our culture! Through Mike Rubin and Kevin hart I’ve donated and help bring millions to the city of Philadelphia! We have real job fairs with reform!" one post reads. "I been in all the jungles lifting communities up for years …. And my rap skills are incredible! Like really really good," the series of posts concludes.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Meek Mill's bizarre Twitter rant attempting to remind fans of his status in hip hop?
