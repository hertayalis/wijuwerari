The pair were married in a small ceremony in 2005 in Tel Aviv. Marcos Ferraez is an actor best known for his work on the television drama Pacific Blue and for guest roles on shows such as Sons of Anarchy, CSI: NY, Law & Order: LA, The Mentalist, and more.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Alona and Marcos currently have one child together.

Reportedly, Alona's net worth alone is $600,000, and it seems she hasn't taken a day off despite becoming a mom. Recently, Alona snagged a recurring role on CBS military drama SEAL Team as Stella Baxter. &nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Alona's character Stella Baxter is a graduate student and former flame to main character Clay Spenser (Max Thieriot). The pair split in Season 2, but with Clay&nbsp;<a href=#>potentially leaving the show</a>, Stella's character arc could be in the balance as well. While many fans have hoped that Clay's traumatic accident would nudge him and Stella back together, so far, a big reunion hasn't happened.&nbsp;</p><p>Alona has been on the show since 2017, so it's hard to imagine SEAL Team without her character's presence, but maybe there are new projects on the horizon.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The list of television shows Alona has appeared on in 2020 alone indicates she could be ready to move on from SEAL Team. She's snagged roles in critically acclaimed Little Fires Everywhere and Netflix show Away.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, she's been happily spending the pandemic at home with her family and often posts cute photos from the family farm. Several of her recent posts appear to be on set for SEAL Team, so let's hope we see more of Stella soon!</p><p>SEAL Team airs on Wednesdays at 10 p.m. EST on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmwusBmq5qkXaKus77Inps%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./opinion-why-meghan-markle-relaunching-her-blog-the-tig-is-a-disastrous-idea.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Opinion: Why Meghan Markle relaunching her blog The Tig is a disastrous idea</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tina-turner-kids-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Details on the Late Singer's Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elias-phoenix-net-worth-142008.html>Elias Phoenix Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gonzalo-lira-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Gonzalo Lira Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./show.html>Rambus DRAM Part 2: Performance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-ratajkowski-sheer-slip-dress-cowboy-boots.html>See Emily Ratajkowski Step Out in a Sheer Slipdress and Cowboy Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-city-has-been-named-the-murder-capital-of-missouri.html>This City Has Been Named the Murder Capital of Missouri</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
