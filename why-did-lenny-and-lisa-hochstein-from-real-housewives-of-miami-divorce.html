In May 2022, fans were shocked when Dr. Lenny Hochstein filed for divorce from Lisa while season 5 of the Bravo show was still filming. Viewers later saw a jaw-dropping hot mic moment in the season where Lenny Hochstein told a friend about his intention to leave his wife.</p><h2 id=h-why-are-lisa-and-lenny-hochstein-separating data-injectable=false>Why are Lisa and Lenny Hochstein separating?</h2><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>The first signs that Lisa and Lenny Hochstein, who got married in 2009, were in a bad place in their marriage, came in early May 2022. The two showed up at a Miami nightclub separately on May 11, 2022, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> reported that the plastic surgeon was there partying with model Katharina Mazepa. At the time, Dr. Lenny told the publication in an email that they were not breaking up.</p><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=817 data-injectable=true>That was short-lived, however, as the RHOM star confirmed to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> on May 16, 2022, that the couple was separating. Lisa Hochstein told the publication in a statement that she was “blindsided by his behavior and reckless handling of the situation.” At the same time, Lenny Hochstein confirmed that the couple was getting a divorce although neither had filed yet because their lawyers were still negotiating the details.</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>In the same statement, he confirmed his relationship with Mazepa but asserted, “Nothing happened between us until we decided on the divorce, and Lisa was aware of my plans before anything happened between Katharina and myself.” The plastic surgeon filed for divorce on May 23 and cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>More details about their divorce came out when season 5 of RHOM premiered, with Lisa Hochstein asserting that her husband left her for Mazepa. Both Mazepa and Dr. Lenny Hochstein, who are now engaged, denied the overlap in relationships.</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>At the RHOM season 5 reunion, Lisa Hochstein admitted that there were issues in the marriage concerning how much money she spent funding her lifestyle as well as her late nights partying. However, she claimed that her estranged husband also partied a lot and didn’t think that either issue warranted a divorce filing.</p><p data-characters=535 data-current-count=858 data-injectable=true>Perhaps the most shocking moment in their separation came during season 5 of RHOM, when Dr. Lenny Hochstein was caught in a hot mic moment telling his friend about his intention to leave Lisa. During that moment, he told his newly single male friend, “In a couple of months, I might be single, too.” When prompted for more details, the surgeon said the couple was having “the same [issues] it’s always been, you know, ‘I do anything I want, whenever I want, and you stay home and go to work and come back.'”</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false>“Are you still sleeping with her?” Lenny Hochstein’s friend asked him in response. “No. You know why?… Because then I would be cheating on who I really care about,” Lenny Hochstein admitted.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=140 data-current-count=140 data-injectable=false>At BravoCon 2023, Lisa Hochstein revealed to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a> that the divorce proceedings were still ongoing, and nothing had been finalized yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tNhmm6KcXaGyr7rYZpinnF2htrStjKGmnKCjqbKquoyfqailXaeyoriMoaauq5Wstrex0mamn2Wdnq6utYydoK%2BnopiycA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./community-rallies-together-after-tragic-hit-and-run-death-of-ashley-mclean-gaylor.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Community Rallies Together After Tragic Hit-and-Run Death of Ashley McLean-Gaylor</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rene-higuita-htm.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rene Higuita - Bio, Age, height, Wiki, Facts and Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elias-phoenix-net-worth-142008.html>Elias Phoenix Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gonzalo-lira-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Gonzalo Lira Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./show.html>Rambus DRAM Part 2: Performance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-ratajkowski-sheer-slip-dress-cowboy-boots.html>See Emily Ratajkowski Step Out in a Sheer Slipdress and Cowboy Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-city-has-been-named-the-murder-capital-of-missouri.html>This City Has Been Named the Murder Capital of Missouri</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
