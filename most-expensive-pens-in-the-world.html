If that’s true, we have compiled a list of the top 10 most expensive pens in the world in this article.</p><p>Writing was the most priceless thing in our evolutionary past. Writing became the most significant method of preserving and disseminating knowledge over time as human memory became insufficient to keep track of everything. Initially, this meant painting shapes on the cave walls and roofs.</p><p>Man created the pen for that reason. You might imagine a quill while thinking of the historical writing instruments. The quill was just one of the pen kinds that existed before the fountain pen we use today.</p><p>We have used pens of different kinds for communication and artistic purposes for many ages. Due to the new technology era, we don’t use pens as frequently as we once did nowadays.</p><p>Making a note on a smartphone is considerably simpler than writing one with a pen and paper. However, not all pens are discarded in this regard. Imagine owning one of the most expensive pens in the world, you definitely will always want to write. Lol! Let’s look at the top 10 most expensive pens in the world.</p><h3>READ ALSO:&nbsp;<a href=#>Top 10 Most Expensive Yachts In The World (2022)</a></h3><h2>Top 10 Most Expensive Pens In The World</h2><p>The table below contains the name and prices of the most expensive pens in the world</p><table style=height:447px width=699><tbody><tr><td><strong>RANK</strong></td><td><strong>NAME</strong></td><td><strong>PRICE</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td>Fulgor Nocturnus by Tibaldi</td><td>$8 million</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Montblanc Boehme Royal Pen</td><td>$1.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>Diamante by Aurora</td><td>$1.28 Million</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Heaven Gold Pen by Anita Tan</td><td>$995,510</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>Mystery Masterpiece</td><td>$750,000</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>Caran d’Ache Gothica Pen</td><td>$406,450</td></tr><tr><td>7.</td><td>Caran D’Ache La Modernista Diamond Pen</td><td>$265,000</td></tr><tr><td>8.</td><td>Montblanc Prince Rainier III Limited Edition 81 Pen</td><td>$256,000</td></tr><tr><td>9.</td><td>Limited Edition Boehme Papillion Pen by Montblanc</td><td>$230,410</td></tr><tr><td>10.</td><td>Perrier-Jouët Anniversary Edition pen by Omas</td><td>$134,700</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>1.
