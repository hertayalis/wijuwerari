Cyrus — of course — <a href=#>played Hannah Montana</a>, and she was joined by stars like Emily Osment, Jason Earles, and Lucas Till. The plot features Cyrus’ character (Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana) getting sent to Tennessee to gain some perspective on what really matters in life.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-miley-cyrus-and-lucas-till-secretly-dated>Miley Cyrus and Lucas Till secretly dated&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-cast-of-Hannah-Montana-The-Movie-including-Miley-Cyrus-and-Lucas-Till.jpg><p id=par-5_64>Disney has been the launching pad for many young stars’ future careers, and interest in what happens to them as they mature and find their place in the entertainment world sparks multiple interviews. A year after the&nbsp;Hannah Montana movie wrapped up, Lucas Till did an interview with Star 94FM to talk about his career, and the topic of his love life garnered some attention.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_101>It was shocking to hear, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shine on Media</a> reports, that he and Miley Cyrus had a brief relationship that lasted two months during filming. Since many celebrity relationships (including ones that both Cyrus and Till would go on to have) become front-page news, it was noteworthy that the young actors had managed to keep the prying eyes of the public away from their brief fling. Till noted in the interview that he believed the real-life chemistry the pair brought to their roles improved the film: “I think it will make the movie a little better cause it was definitely real.”</p><h2 id=h-cyrus-and-till-have-gone-on-to-other-relationships>Cyrus and Till have gone on to other relationships</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-7_21>It’s been many years since the young stars’ paths crossed during filming, and they’ve both gone on to some headline-grabbing relationships.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_71>Lucas Till, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranker</a>, has been linked to a host of stars, including Taylor Swift (who he dated after appearing in her music video), Kayslee Collins (who he dated from 2010 to 2012), and Carlson Young (who he dated from 2012 to 2014). Till — who continues to act and was <a href=#>recently in&nbsp;MacGyver</a> — is either single or keeping his love life out of the headlines, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hello!

She entered a serious relationship with Liam Hemsworth that fizzled out. Afterward, Cyrus went on to date Patrick Schwarzenegger and Stella Maxwell. Cyrus then famously returned to her relationship with Hemsworth, and the two even tied the knot in 2018, but the relationship hit a rough patch and <a href=#>had ended by 2020</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_52>Recently, Cyrus has been romantically linked to drummer Maxx Morando. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> reports that Morando is six years younger than Cyrus and potentially the topic of her recent song “You.” The two have stayed fairly quiet about the exact nature of their relationship, but fans have certainly been on the lookout for details.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6qrjEsmScsaKqwG6wwK2cnWWYlruvrcdmpKimpJa7onnCqGSsrJGneq3BwpqqZqyZoblvtNOmo2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nevada-vs-temple-prediction-odds-college-basketball-picks-12212023.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nevada vs. Temple Prediction, Odds, College Basketball Picks [12/21/2023]</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./robert-kaplan-md-abc284be.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dr. Robert Kaplan, MD Chicago, IL</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elias-phoenix-net-worth-142008.html>Elias Phoenix Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gonzalo-lira-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Gonzalo Lira Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./show.html>Rambus DRAM Part 2: Performance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-ratajkowski-sheer-slip-dress-cowboy-boots.html>See Emily Ratajkowski Step Out in a Sheer Slipdress and Cowboy Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-city-has-been-named-the-murder-capital-of-missouri.html>This City Has Been Named the Murder Capital of Missouri</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
