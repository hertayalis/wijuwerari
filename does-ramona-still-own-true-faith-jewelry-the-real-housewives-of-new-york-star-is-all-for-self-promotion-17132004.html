I find that an aphrodisiac." Now, her ex-husband, Mario, had money, too, but it's admirable how Ramona never wanted to have to depend on anyone else and thus went out to make her own fortune. She's had a few skincare lines and some other questionable ventures, but<a href=# class=T3D> does Ramona still own True Faith Jewelry </a>on Real Housewives Of New York? Her business is, well, still in business.</p><p>When Ramona married Mario,<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> he worked for Classic Medallics, Inc.</a>, the Singer family business that started in 1940 with the specialization of religious jewelry and gifts. The company then, in the late 1950s according to its website, got into the business of producing trophies, plaques, and other awards. Ramona and Mario founded True Faith Jewelry together in 2005, probably as a means to provide more fashionable and fine jewelry options to people who wanted religious accessories and personalized gifts. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>According to its About Us page, </a>True Faith Jewelry offers a wide variety of religious and secular jewelry that's "domestically made," and it all "comes with a guarantee from defective finishing and breakage."</p><p>There's no word if Ramona is officially still working with the company —&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>it's not listed as a business </a>on Ramona's official page —&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>but the website still works</a>, and you can still order.</p><p>Interestingly enough, Ramona told AdWeek that she and Mario originally signed on to Real Housewives Of New York as a means to promote their then-new business. “<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>We sat down as a family</a> and discussed it with Avery,” she said. “We told her we thought it would be good for her father’s website. I asked her, ‘Don’t you like your tennis lessons and private school?’” Obviously, Ramona and Mario's gamble paid off, because we are still talking about True Faith Jewelry at this very moment. Their relationship may not have survived over a decade of being on Real Housewives Of New York, but the business did!</p><p>Right now, Ramona <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>is working on Ageless By Ramona</a>, her skincare line, not to mention clothing for Amazon, and more, but it doesn't mean she's moved away from the jewelry game. According to Bravo, in 2018, Ramona and daughter Avery <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>designed a necklace</a> for domestic violence nonprofit Safe Horizon. On her Instagram Story, Ramona said of the piece, "I designed this piece for Safe Horizon with Encircle, and 100 percent of the proceeds go to Safe Horizon. And I have it in this size, and a mini size, so it will be like a mother-daughter [look]."</p><p><a href=# class=T3D>Ramona's marriage </a>may have crumbled, but her relationship with her daughter is great, and her businesses are doing well. She also seems to be having a wonderful time dating around the city, and it's nice to see that Ramona is still flourishing even after all these years on television. The Real Housewives Of New York star got her start in order to sell her products on television, and it doesn't seem like she'll slow down anytime soon.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC8jp2mnqtdp66uu82aZKysmaG5brvWp2StqqWaeqetyK2fZqKVrLKtvthmq6GdXaeyoriMoaauq5Wstrex0mamn2WemsRuxc6romarpJa%2FbrXSZpilpF2bvLN50p6jn2Wgp7yuu9OipqdlYWx%2BdH6PaWs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./logan-paul-reaches-historic-milestone-in-wwe.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Logan Paul Reaches Historic Milestone In WWE</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cailee-spaeny-age-how-old-is-she-actress-net-worth-and-career.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cailee Spaeny Age | How Old Is She | Actress Net Worth And Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elias-phoenix-net-worth-142008.html>Elias Phoenix Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gonzalo-lira-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Gonzalo Lira Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./show.html>Rambus DRAM Part 2: Performance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-ratajkowski-sheer-slip-dress-cowboy-boots.html>See Emily Ratajkowski Step Out in a Sheer Slipdress and Cowboy Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-city-has-been-named-the-murder-capital-of-missouri.html>This City Has Been Named the Murder Capital of Missouri</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
