Kidman told <a href=#>DuJour</a>&nbsp;that she was happy during most of the time and that she didn't think her marriage would end the way it did.&nbsp;"It took me a very long time to heal. It was a shock to my system,"&nbsp;she said. Kidman did try to save her marriage and even wanted Cruise to give their union a second chance. In response to the actor's divorce petition, Kidman apparently&nbsp;"protested [Cruise's] intention to dissolve their marriage and urged him not to leave but to enter marriage counseling with her," but Cruise wasn't having it, per <a href=#>ABC News</a>. As far as Cruise was concerned, they were done and there was no turning back. Kidman was hurt, but Cruise was adamant that she had no place in his future anymore.</p><p>Kidman also told DuJour that, because <a href=#>her split from Cruise was so heartbreaking</a>, she never thought she would find love again. She said, "Our life together was perfect. It took me a very long time to heal." But there was another painful secret Kidman kept to herself— the massive grief she experienced while married to one of the biggest Hollywood stars in the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcW1maIJze9OhnGannpp6tbTIp55mrJiWwW601KurZqaZmLytsYykoJ2lkaN6tbTEZqSoq6Ritq95x56pZpyZq7yzr8Ro</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-flula-borg-dating-now-past-relationships-current-status-and-rumours-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Flula Borg Dating Now?
