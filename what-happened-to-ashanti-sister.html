Over the last 20 years, the Long Island, N.Y., native has delivered a share of hits that have broken records and helped build a solid fanbase. Additionally, Ashanti secured a Grammy win for Best Contemporary R&B album in 2003.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Aside from Ashanti’s accomplishments in music, she has always remained grounded and close with family, which includes her younger sister Kenashia "Shia" Douglas, aka <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lil Tuneshi</a>. As expected, the pair are much more than sisters, so it comes as no surprise that Ashanti is always ready to defend her Shia’s honor.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Unfortunately, in a recent interview on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Table Talk</a>, Ashanti, Kenashia "Shia," and their mother Tina, discussed Shia’s life-changing experience that brought the singer into protective mode. So, what happened to Ashanti’s sister? Here’s everything that we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Ashanti's sister?</h2><p>On the November 22, 2022, episode of Jada Pinkett Smith’s Red Table Talk, Ashanti, Shia, and family matriarch Tina, discussed how the family dealt with Shia experiencing domestic violence at the hands of an ex-boyfriend.</p><p>The longtime mental abuse that Shia’s ex-boyfriend subjected her to turned physical after the pair rekindled their romance.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Shia added that the ex-boyfriend had a habit of reaching out to her after physically abusing her.</p><p>“He would try to come around with gifts,” Shia told Jada, Willow Smith, and Adrienne Banfield-Norris, as Tina added that he would cry about his actions to win Shia over.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While Shia did take her ex-boyfriend back on numerous occasions, the abuse continued for the last two and a half years of their 13-year relationship.</p><p>Shia also shared that her ex-boyfriend made threats prior to hitting her, but she never believed that the person she loved would hurt her until he did.</p><p>“There were times where I was on my best friend’s bed sleeping and he was literally in the window taking pictures of me and sending pictures to my phone,” Shia recalled.</p><p>On one occasion, Ashanti shared that she took matters into her own hands once Shia informed her about what was going on.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>“I was like, ‘Oh nah,” Ashanti shared. “I went in the garage, I got the bat, I pulled up in the truck, I had Vaseline. I was ready. I was by myself and I had the adrenaline.”</p><p>Thankfully, Shia ultimately decided to end the relationship. Since then, Shia has been vocal about her experience on social media, in particular, with an April 2020 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> post. Ashanti also shared her support and spread awareness with an October 2021 Domestic Violence Awareness <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post of her own.</a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In November 2021, Shia shared that she created Wife of Creation to help people who have experienced domestic violence.</h2><p>In a November 2021 interview with Power 105.1’s Angie Martinez, Shia, Ashanti, and Tina also took a moment to discuss how domestic violence impacted their family. And while Shia has since moved on from the situation, she has decided to use her past as a way to help others, via the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wife of Creation</a> initiative and holistic lifestyle brand.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“Wife of Creation is an extension of my healing journey,” Shia told Angie. “I’m basically offering resources for people, so there is mental health, nutritionists, we have martial arts therapy, boxing."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Unfortunately, domestic violence continues to be an international problem. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hotline</a>, “intimate partner violence alone affects more than 12 million people every year.”</p><p>Additionally, the organization shares that “one in four women (24.3 percent) and one in seven men (13.8 percent) aged 18 and older in the U.S. have been the victim of severe physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime.<strong>”</strong></p><p>It takes a strong person to recall their experiences with domestic violence and for that, we applaud Shia and her family for spreading awareness.</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSaq5iWu7W1jKygrKyVpw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./winter-house-what-is-austen-krolls-height-and-age-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Winter House What is Austen Krolls height and age</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./todrick-hall-gofundme-drama.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Todrick Hall Is in the Middle of GoFundMe Drama Details</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elias-phoenix-net-worth-142008.html>Elias Phoenix Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gonzalo-lira-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Gonzalo Lira Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./show.html>Rambus DRAM Part 2: Performance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-ratajkowski-sheer-slip-dress-cowboy-boots.html>See Emily Ratajkowski Step Out in a Sheer Slipdress and Cowboy Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-city-has-been-named-the-murder-capital-of-missouri.html>This City Has Been Named the Murder Capital of Missouri</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
