Brewer refused and walked home, with Bent following.<br></span></p><p><span>Once they reached the Brewer home, police say Bent tried to steal a bicycle and also stood on the street yelling threats at Brewer family members, even challenging Brewer's father to come outside and fight.</span><br></p><p><span>'He came to my house.

'It was because he wanted me to buy something from him that I didn't want to buy.'</span><br></p><p><span>Fearing retaliation, Brewer's parents notified school administrators they were keeping him home the following day. A little after school let out at 2:40pm, Brewer decided to walk over to a friend's house.<br></span></p><p><span>At the same time, Bent was wheeling around the neighborhood on his bicycle.

Several of the boys said Brewer agreed to eventually pay and the two of them shook hands.<br></span></p><p><span>Brewer and another boy walked away, climbing over the low Lime Tree wall into the parking lot. Jarvis and Bent began discussing what to do with the jug of rubbing alcohol.</span><br></p><p><span>'That's when they're like, "We should pour it on him just to mess with him",' Kenny told police. 'I thought they would pour it on him, kind of soak him, and then run.

And we heard more screaming. It sounded like painful screaming,' Nielsen said.</span><br></p><p><span>The two of them rushed outside and saw Brewer on fire and running. They yelled that he should stop, drop and roll, but he was heading for an apartment complex pool. He jumped the fence and plunged into the water.</span><br></p><p><span>The group of boys scattered in several directions. Jarvis dropped the empty rubbing alcohol jug into a garbage can.<br></span></p><p><span>Brewer tore off his burning shirt, leaving a scorched area in the grass where it landed. The alcohol also ignited a small fire in some bushes. The hair was singed off one of Mendez's arms.</span><br></p><p><span>Nielsen ran over to where Brewer was in the pool, dialing 911 on a neighbor's cell phone. She coaxed Brewer out of the water. In the background on the call Brewer can be heard screaming in pain.</span><br></p><p><span>'He's 15 years old ... and, and his skin is peeling off,' Nielsen told the dispatcher. 'Somebody poured stuff on him.'</span><br></p><p><span>'Please help me!' Brewer yelled over and over.</span><br></p><p><span>Paramedics arrived and Brewer was airlifted to a Miami hospital. It was far from certain that he would survive.<br></span></p><p><span>Two of the boys went to check on Brewer at the pool, promising him they'd go tell his mother what happened.</span><br></p><p><span>'He had burnt skin everywhere,' Kenny said.</span><br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/06/05/article-0-1374D649000005DC-413_634x373.jpg height=373 width=634 alt="Leftover: The burnt clothes belonging to Michael Brewer after he was splashed with a flammable liquid.

Everything turns on what he actually said, because he didn't commit any physical acts against the victim,' Franks said.</span><br></p><p><span>Brewer has largely recovered physically from his lengthy hospitalization and rehabilitation. He and his family now live in Palm Beach County.
