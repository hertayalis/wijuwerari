When anyone thinks of Tina, they probably automatically think of her famous tracks "Proud Mary" or "What's Love Got to Do with It."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>If you didn't know, the singer was married twice and had four kids — two of them are her biological ones and the other two are adopted. Unfortunately, before Tina died, she endured two devastating losses of her children. Keep reading to learn the details about Tina's kids and family life.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where are Tina Turner's kids now?</h2><p>Tina had her first child when she was 18 with Raymond Hill, a saxophonist for the band Kings of Rhythm.<strong> </strong>His name was Craig, and he was born in 1958. But, sadly, in 2018, Craig died by suicide. He was only 59 years old.</p><p>A Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner spokesperson told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> that Tina's eldest was pronounced dead after being found in his Studio City, Calif., home with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Craig was the only son she had with Raymond. But just a few years after the birth of her oldest son, she started seeing another member of the Kings of Rhythm band — <a href=#>Ike Turner</a> (the frontman of the group) — and she had her second kid with him, <a href=#>Ronnie Turner</a>. Two years after Ronnie was born, Tina and Ike got married. Once they became husband and wife, the musicians adopted each other's kids from previous relationships. Ike had two sons, Ike Jr. and Michael.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ronnie</a> was born in 1960 and made his on-screen debut in his mother's "What's Love Got to Do with It" music video in 1993. In 2007, he tied the knot with French singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Afida Turner</a>. Afida and Ronnie had a close relationship with Tina and often played with Tina at her shows. Throughout his life, Ronnie continued growing his music career with songs like “Chuck’s Back” and “Cough and Drop.”</p><p>Sadly, the artist died on Thursday, Dec. 8, 2022.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, law enforcement officials answered a 911 call from someone concerned about Ronnie’s well-being. The caller found Ronnie outside of his house, struggling to breathe. When the paramedics arrived at the San Fernando Valley, Calif., home, Ronnie had completely stopped breathing. After several attempts to revive him, Ronnie was pronounced dead on the scene at age 62.</p><p>Ronnie’s official <a href=#>cause of death</a> was complications of metastatic colon carcinoma, also known as colon cancer, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>. The L.A. County Coroner’s Office added that Ronnie developed atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease before he died, a condition that can make the artery walls harder and stop blood from flowing to the heart.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Ronnie was Tina’s second biological child and died just four years after his big brother, Craig. Upon the news of Ronnie's death, Tina <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took to Instagram</a> to pay tribute to her son. “Ronnie, you left the world far too early,” the singer wrote. “In sorrow, I close my eyes and think of you, my beloved son.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tina is survived by adopted sons Ike Jr. and Michael Turner.</h2><p>Tina and Ike’s other sons have typically stayed away from the public. However, like his mother and father, Ike Jr. seemed to go the musical route. He formed a band called The Love Thang alongside artist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweet Randi Love</a>. They released their first single as a group in 2017 called "Freaky!" As for Michael, there isn't much information about him as he hasn't been in the spotlight.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tina and Ike divorced in the '70s.</h2><p>After being <a href=#>married for almost 20 years</a>, the two were legally separated in 1978. Tina had initially filed, citing "irreconcilable differences." But in her autobiography — I, Tina: My Life Story — she opened up about Ike being an abusive partner.</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Oprah</a> in 2005, she talked about how her son Craig had witnessed the abuse and was definitely affected by it.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"One day when Ike was fighting me, Craig knocked on the door and said, ‘Mother, are you all right?’ I thought, ‘Oh, please, don’t beat me at home.’ I didn’t want my children to hear,” she revealed to Oprah. Tina also mentioned that Craig “was a very emotional kid.”</p><p>Tina's ex-husband died in 2007 of a cocaine overdose. She got married again in 2013 to <a href=#>Erwin Bach</a>, who is 16 years younger than her. They started dating in 1986, shortly after her first marriage with Ike.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What was Tina Turner's cause of death?</h2><p>On May 24, 2023, Tina Turner died at the age of 83 in Switzerland, where she had been living with her husband Erwin.
