Meanwhile, Ric will always be remembered for the dramatic display he brought to the ring.</p><p class=dh>Ric Flair knew early on what he was meant to do in life. In boarding school, he twice won the state private school wrestling championship <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.wwe.com/superstars/ricflair>in 1966</a> and 1968.</p><p class=dh>Years before he got the nickname, "The Nature Boy," Ric Flair lived in a tranquil environment. He was adopted from an orphanage, and his father was a doctor who lived a simple lifestyle and practiced frugality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/5f909504859290362c3948b03eadef65.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Ric Flair attends the premiere of "The Wrestler" in Los Angeles, California on December 16, 2008 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>RIC LOVED SPENDING</strong></p><p class=dh>In contrast, Ric's lifestyle as an adult would include a lot of fancy clothes. He also didn't mind spending on expensive rides. Ric, a 16-time pro wrestling world champion, once <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p081pc3b>called</a> himself a "limousine- riding, jet flying, son of a gun."</p><p class=dh>It's safe to that this is true. Ric loved traveling and showing off his expensive suits and his reptile skin shoes. At random times, he would walk into a car dealership and pick up a Mercedes-Benz.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f7e476d165c891479c3a9eab1290089a.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Ric Flair attends game three of the NBA Finals in Cleveland, Ohio on June 7, 2017 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>BARELY ESCAPING DEATH</strong></p><p class=dh>Ric could be considered one of the luckiest men in the world after surviving a devastating plane crash in 1975. He came out with a broken back, while fellow wrestler Johnny Valentine was left paralyzed.</p><p class=dh>Ric resumed his wrestling career eight months after the crash. The return delighted loyal fans who had missed his presence. Of course, he came back with his signature expression, "Woooo!" and riled up crowds.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>YOUNGEST SON'S DEATH</strong></p><p class=dh>Ric has a beautiful family and tries his best to maintain a strong bond with them. Sadly, Ric's youngest son Reid died <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thethings.com/sketchy-facts-about-the-flair-family/>in 2013</a> of an overdose. At the time, Ric was in Japan for a blood clot in his leg.</p><p class=dh>Unfortunately, Ric was nowhere near Reid when he got a final text from his son. Ric is also father to Megan and David from his first marriage to Leslie Goodman. He shares daughter Ashley with his second wife, Elizabeth Harrell.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/a750370b8910938b0610c1964291be9d.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Ric Flair at the ESPN portion of the Summer Television Critics Association Press Tour on July 26, 2017, in Beverly Hills, California | Photo" Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ABOUT CHARLOTTE FLAIR</strong></p><p class=dh>Ric's daughter Ashley, whose ring name is Charlotte, was voted the top female wrestler in 2016. She was one of the first women to headline WrestleMania, WWE's flagship event.</p><p class=dh>Prior to her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.wwe.com/superstars/charlotte-flair>2016 title</a>, Charlotte also won an eight-woman tournament back in 2014. This landed her the title of the NXT TakeOver women's champion. It set a solid foundation for healthy competition in the arena.</p><p class=dh>As a beginner on Raw, Charlotte managed to snag the Divas Title, a feat no one had managed before her. On many subsequent occasions, Charlotte would establish herself as the Raw women's champion.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>COVID-19 OR NOT</strong></p><p class=dh>In July of 2020, <a class="me a" href=#>Ric</a>'s wife Wendy was diagnosed with COVID-19, leading many to believe that Ric also had the illness. However, despite the spiraling claims and the assumptions by the public, Ric denied it.</p><p class=dh>The allegations began after someone allegedly familiar with the retired wrestler saw him at a Starbucks drive-through. The source was also aware that Ric's wife, Wendy, had been diagnosed with the virus.</p><p class=dh>Ric explained that while his wife did have the coronavirus, they live in a 5,000 square foot house and he was safely tucked away in the basement while his wife resided on the third floor. Wendy is Ric's fifth wife.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtqbG9jbHquscStZKuhk2Kzra3Iq2ScoJGnubDA055kn6SRnr9uu82eZLCvlah7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./natalie-guercio.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Natalie Guercio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeannie-elise-mai-net-worth-246797.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jeannie Elise Mai Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elias-phoenix-net-worth-142008.html>Elias Phoenix Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gonzalo-lira-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>Gonzalo Lira Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./show.html>Rambus DRAM Part 2: Performance</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-ratajkowski-sheer-slip-dress-cowboy-boots.html>See Emily Ratajkowski Step Out in a Sheer Slipdress and Cowboy Boots</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-city-has-been-named-the-murder-capital-of-missouri.html>This City Has Been Named the Murder Capital of Missouri</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamBlog.
