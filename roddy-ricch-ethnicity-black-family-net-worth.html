Wikipedia Bio And Net Worth</a></p><h2 style=color:#252525>Roddy Ricch Ethnicity: Is He Black or White?</h2><p style=color:#252525>The parents of rapper Ricch are of African American descent and are from Atlanta, Georgia, so that makes him of African descent.</p><p style=color:#252525>The veteran rapper’s skin tone reflects his family’s origin and history, which is thought to have African roots.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Roddy-Ricch-2.jpg><p style=color:#252525>However, his ancestral heritage is not known at the moment. Furthermore, he is of American nationality.</p><h2 style=color:#252525>Roddy Ricch&nbsp;Family Background</h2><p style=color:#252525>Moore Jr. was born in a Christian household on October 22, 1998, in Compton, California. He was raised in a middle-class family and had access to all the necessities he required as a young boy because of his parents’ financial assistance.</p><p style=color:#252525>At the age of eight, he started rapping; at twelve, he performed for superstar and fellow Compton local Kendrick Lamar.</p><p style=color:#252525>The singer attended Compton High School for his schooling. He experienced a violent awakening, which put him in several risky circumstances.</p><p style=color:#252525>He used to be a member of the Compton gang known as the Park Village Compton Crips. His torso has two “C” tattoos to signify his previous gang affiliation.</p><p style=color:#252525>At the young age of 15, his parents took action by ejecting him from their home due to the intensity of his involvement in street life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Roddy-Ricch-11.jpg><p style=color:#252525>Rodrick began actively composing beats at the age of 16.

Before that, he and his family spent most of his formative years moving from place to place.</span></p><p style=color:#252525><span style=font-family:var(--global-body-font-family);color:#252525>His parents’ travels when he was a little child eventually inspired his music style decades later.</span></p><h2 style=color:#252525>Roddy Ricch’s Net Worth: Explored</h2><p style=color:#252525>The rapper has been in the music industry since he was a teenager, and he has over two dozen official tracks to his credit.
