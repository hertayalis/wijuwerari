He recognises the potential in Ja’s talent and constantly pushes him to reach new heights.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>While Morant’s love for his son shines through his unwavering support, he also possesses a discerning eye that allows him to provide constructive criticism when necessary. </span><span style=font-weight:400>With a desire to see Ja continually improve, Morant offers valuable insights and guidance to help shape his son’s game.</span></p><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>While his words might seem like constructive criticism of Ja’s performances, basketball spectators are always shocked by how harsh his words are whenever he speaks of his son.&nbsp;</span><span style=font-weight:400>Morant once said that </span><a href=# rel=noopener><i><span style=font-weight:400>Ja played like trash.

He attended an NBA camp, hoping to impress scouts and secure a spot on a team. However, he received feedback that he did not meet the height requirements that teams were seeking. Despite this setback, Morant remained determined to continue his basketball journey.</span></p><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Seeking opportunities to showcase his skills, &nbsp;Morant joined a </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>semi-professional team in Colombia. </span></a><span style=font-weight:400>&nbsp;He, however, encountered difficulties with player salaries and faced challenges during his time in South America. It became clear that pursuing a professional basketball career overseas was not the ideal path for him.</span></p><p style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>During this critical juncture in Morant’s life, he received life-changing news: Jamie Morant, his partner, was expecting their son.
